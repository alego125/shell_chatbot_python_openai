# 🐍🤖OpenAI ChatBot in the terminal of our operating system


## ⚙ SETUP
---------
1) Create a virtual environment using the command
~~~
python -m venv venv 
~~~
2) Activate the virtual environment using the command
~~~
venv/Scripts/activate
~~~
3) Install dependencies using the command
~~~
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

## 💨 Run the program
--------
First of all, you must make sure that you have obtained the API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Once you have saved the API key, you can proceed with the following steps

After this, what we need to do is make sure that line 5 of the code where it says PUT_YOUR_API_KEY is replaced with the character string of the generated API key, so that we can make the requests correctly

To run the program, open the command prompt and execute the following command:
~~~
python main.py
~~~

After this, we will be able to make requests normally from the console. To exit, we simply press "exit" as it says in the application code
